                <div id="info">Hey! I'm Ren Barklow, a 3D Game Artist specializing in 3D Modeling and Animation. 
                    I am currently an undergrad student at the University of Utah. I am pursueing a Bachelor's of 
                    Science degree in Games with a minor in Gender Studies, expecting to graduate May 2027.
                    <br> <br>
                    I knew I wanted to be a game artist since taking an Intro to 3D Animation class in high school and 
                    watching development videos of my favorite game at the time, <i>The Isle</i>. 
                    I quickly realizied I have an aptitude for the art and a passion that could drive me for a lifetime. 
                    I have 5+ years experience in Maya and have used many other softwares for various projects including, 
                    but not limited to: Substance Painter, Photoshop, Blender, Unreal Engine, Unity, ZBrush, etc.
                    <br> <br>
                    In addition to making games, I also love playing them, digitally painting, critically analyzing games, 
                    narrative, film, and other media, knitting, watching video essays, reading, and hanging out with my cat. I have 
                    interests in dinosaurs and past-life, creature design, environmentalism, activism, physical movement, and any 
                    type of art.
